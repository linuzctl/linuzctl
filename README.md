# 👋 Hey, I’m linuzctl

<p align="center">
  Linux tinkerer • Kubernetes wrangler • Homelab enthusiast<br>
  <em>Yes, I use Arch btw.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  I spend most of my time building, breaking, and rebuilding infrastructure — usually on Linux, often on Kubernetes, and occasionally on projects that will probably stay experimental.
</p>

## What I’m into

- 🐧 **Linux** (daily driver, servers, everything in between)
- ☸️ **Kubernetes** (cluster automation, Operators, GitOps, Helm)
- 🛠 **Infrastructure as Code** (Ansible, OpenTofu/Terraform)
- 💻 **Programming** (Golang, scripting for automation)
- _Side projects that may or may not ever be “done”_
